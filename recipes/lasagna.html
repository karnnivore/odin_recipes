            <li>
                <strong>Step - 1</strong>
                <p>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Swirl to coat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                    Add the sausage, red pepper, and mushrooms; saute until meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step - 2</strong>
                <p>Stir in the Ragu® Old World Style® Traditional sauce, 
                broken lasagna noodles, water, and rosemary. Cover and turn heat down to medium-low.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step - 3</strong>
                <p>Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente. Remove the 
                    lid and add the ricotta, 2/3 of the cheese, and parsley; stir to combine. Top with 
                    remaining mozzarella and serve immediately.</p>
